I am learning Java.

It is currently my fifth month of Java, and I am trying to learn data structures since things like recursion and hash tables are things that are essential to getting a job at a tech company.

So, I decided to try to learn how to code data structures in java, which is easy since java is a very object oriented language (its the main reason why there is a lot of boilerplate code).

Shoutout to geeksForGeeks for teaching me all this stuff

just search up GeeksForGeeks, they should come up, they have examples in a lot of languages:
