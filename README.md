I am learning Java.

It is currently my third month of Java, and I am trying to learn data structures since things like recursion and hash tables are things that are essential to getting a job at a tech company.

So, I decided to try to learn how to code data structures in java, which is easy since java is a very object oriented language (its the main reason why there is a lot of boilerplate code).

Shoutout to Bro Codez for teaching me how to make a dynamic array WITHOUT importing the classes required:
